## MLOps Foundations

**Notes**

This chapter focuses on covering some base to build a strong foundation for using MLOps methodologies.

**Bash and Linux Command Line** Best resource to learn : https://missing.csail.mit.edu/

**Getting started with cloud computing**: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/building-cloud-computing-solutions-at-scale#courses

**Python crash course**: https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents.html

**Math for programmers**: https://mml-book.github.io/

Using the [TensorFlow Playground](https://oreil.ly/ojebX), experiment with changing the hyperparameters across different datasets as well as problem types. Can you identify optimal configurations of  hidden layers, learning rate, and regularization rate for different  datasets?

End to end example of creating MLOps pipelines from zero (implemented under exercises folder) on 3 different cloud platforms

- Build and deploy ML application on AWS, GCP and Azure with Github events trigger (continuous delivery).
